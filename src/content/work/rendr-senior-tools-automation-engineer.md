#### **Key Achievements:**

- **Implemented Terraform** for infrastructure automation, including GitHub Actions workflows, documentation, and training.
- **Automated invoicing** by integrating with Xero, enabling efficient invoice generation for the accounting team.
- **Developed a suite of Zendesk apps** to enhance delivery operations.
